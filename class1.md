Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, 

adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. 

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.

Mobile devices generally do a pretty decent job of displaying websites these days. Sometimes they could use a little assistance though, particularly around identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website. To remedy this, Apple invented the viewport meta tag.

Float is a CSS positioning property.

While floats can still be used for layout, these days, we have much stronger tools for creating layout on web pages. Namely, Flexbox and Grid. Floats are still useful to know about because they have some abilities entirely unique to them, which is all covered in this article.

Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.

“Clear: left” tells each person floating left that they should align themselves behind the first element that is floated left.


The vast majority of websites out there use a grid. They may not explicitly have a grid system in place, but if they have a “main content area” floated to the left a “sidebar” floated to the right, it’s a simple grid.
