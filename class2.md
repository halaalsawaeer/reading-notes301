jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common
JavaScript tasks quickly

1. In order to use jQuery, the first
thing you need to do is include
the jQuery script in your page.
You can see that it is included
before the closing body tag.

jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. 

jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve
the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write
with plain JavaScript. 
Using jQuery, you usually select elements
using CSS-style selectors.

If you want to use more than
one jQuery method on the same
selection of elements, you can
list several methods at a time
using dot notation to separate
each one

The • htm 1 () and • text () methods both retrieve and update the content
of elements.

Inserting new elements involves two steps:
1: Create the new elements in a jQuery object
2: Use a method to insert the content into the page 


You can create attributes, or access and update
their contents, using jQuery

The . css () method lets you retrieve
and set the values of CSS properties. 

jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality
of a loop on a selection of elements, using the
• each () method. 

The • on () method is used to handle all events. 


The .animate() method allows you to create
some of your own effects and animations by
changing CSS properties. 

The position of script elements can affect
how quickly a web page seems to load.
