Roy Fielding  He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

“http” tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
 it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
 The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
 A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. 
 URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
