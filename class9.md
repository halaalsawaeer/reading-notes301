Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure

Immutability
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

trim: removes whitespace from both ends of a string

The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.

When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
takes one or more functions as arguments, or
returns a function as its result
