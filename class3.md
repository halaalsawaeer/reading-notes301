Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.
The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything

It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags.

By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

flex-wrap
two rows of boxes, the first wrapping down onto the second
By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
flex-direction
the four possible values of flex-direction being shown: top to bottom, bottom to top, right to left, and left to right

This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.

display
This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
